# Developing-Predictive-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Clinical-Data-Analsyis
This research aims to develop a novel machine learning framework for improved detection and prediction of metabolic disorders. Using a well-characterized dataset from prior studies, the model will help mitigate long-term metabolic and cardiovascular risks for patients.
